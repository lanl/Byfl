- Left off:
  - Ran CICE with byfl
    - copied cice source to byfl-tests/tests
    - modified bld/Macros.Linux.LANL.darwin for gcc build
    - modified byfl-env to set OMPI_FC=bf-gfortran
    - added '-p' arg to comp_ice to set # of ranks
    - modified comp_ice to use ${PWD} as source directory
  - Ran S3D
    - copied source to byfl-tests/tests
    - create 'build' dir and run 'cmake -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=bf-mpif90 ..' in build
    - run 'make install'
      - this creates 's3d_run' directory in s3d
      - cd to s3d_run/run and run s3d.x
  - modified bf-gcc wrapper in tools/wrappers
    - added 
        elsif ($opt eq "rdynamic") {
        }
      to 'link' code block
    - was getting link error when running cmake on s3d 
      
- creating global variables in llvm:
  - write a simple c source file, compile it to bitcode using
    clang -S -emit-llvm -c foo.cc
  - then run
    llc -march=cpp foo.bc -o foo.lc
